# Signalbash Plugin Manual

The Signalbash Plugin is a free and open source audio plugin that you
can place on your DAW to track how long you've been actively working
on creating music, podcasts, or other types of audio content.

## Downloading & Installing The Plugin

The Signalbash Plugin can be downloaded from
[https://signalbash.com/plugin-download](https://signalbash.com/plugin-download).

The download page on signalbash.com will download the installer appropriate for
your computer.

## Plugin Types

The installer will give you the option to install the following plugin types:

- VST3
- CLAP
- AU (macOS only)


VST2 is not available.


### If Signalbash doesn't appear after installation

If you're using a DAW or on an OS that doesn't support CLAP or AU, you might
not see the Signalbash plugin appear immediately. For example, if you're
using Ableton Live 11 on a Windows computer.

Some DAWs don't enable VST3 by default, and only have VST2 folder enabled by
default. 

If you don't see the plugin listed in your DAW's plugins list, ensure
that your DAW has the VST3 folder enabled.

Once you've verified that you've enabled VST3 in your DAW, click rescan
plugins, and Signalbash should appear.

The Installer will install each plugin type at the following locations on your
computer:

### macOS
