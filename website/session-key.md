# Signalbash Session Key

The Session Key is an essential part of using Signalbash. In order for the
Signalbash Plugin to properly associate your DAW Activity with your profile,
you have to enter your session key in the plugin.

## How To Get A Session Key

You get a session key when you create a Signalbash account.

Creating a signalbash account is free, and does not require an email address.

Accounts must be created on ([signalbash.com](https://signalbash.com)).

Once you create an account, you can get your session key by looking in the
toolbar at the top of the site for the "Copy Session Key" button. Click this
and the session key will copied to your clipboard.

Treat your session key like a password. We take pains to obscure your session
key from being easily viewable in plain text on the site. If you need to see
your session key in full, be sure you aren't streaming or recording your screen,
then go to Account Settings, and click the "Show Session Key" button.

## How To Set Your Session Key

When you open the Signalbash Plugin in a DAW for the first time, the plugin will
ask you for your session key. Login to your Signalbash account, click the button
to copy the key to your device's clipboard, then go back to the plugin and paste
the session key.


#### Tip
We have noticed that some hosts don't allow you to press the `CMD-V` or `CTRL-V`
keyboard shortcut. If that happens, try right clicking in the session key input
field in the plugin, and clicking paste.


## Do I Have To Re-Enter My Session Key Each Time I Use The Plugin?

No. You only have to enter your session key once. Once you do this, each
subsequent time you open up the Plugin in a DAW session, the session key
you most recently entered will automatically be loaded in the plugin.

## Changing Your Session Key

If you have multiple Signalbash accounts associated with different profiles,
you can change your session key to change the account where your activity is
being accumulated.

To do this, open the Signalbash Plugin UI in your DAW. Then, click the settings
cog icon in the top right corner. A button will appear that says "Change Session Key".
Input your other session key, and your plugin will start using it immediately.


## Don't Lose Your Session Key

Because signalbash.com doesn't require email addresses to create an account, if
you forget your username or password, you can regain access to your account via
your session key.

For this reason, it's very important that you keep your session key safe and
never save it in a public location.
