# The Signalbash Website

The Signalbash Website ([signalbash.com](https://signalbash.com)) is where you
can create an account, review your activity, view the leaderboard, manage your 
signalbash profile, and download the signalbash plugin.


## Features

### Leaderboard

The Signalbash leaderboard is a ranked list of everyone who has used Signalbash
to track their activity in the past 24 hours. It will show how long each artist
has been working, as reported by the Signalbash Plugin, along with the DAW(s) or software they used. It will also show personalizable information about each artist, including a profile image, a display or user name, and country.

### Plugin Download

For more information about how to Install & Use the Signalbash plugin,
see its dedicated manual here: [Signalbash Plugin](/plugin/signalbash-plugin-manual)

### Profile Features

Your signalbash profile features stats related to your activity, as well as
standard profile information fields which you can customize.

#### Activity Stats

- Activity Chart (All Time)
    - This chart is private and viewable only by you. It contains a chart
      of your active DAW usage over the past 24 hours.
- Activity Summary (All Time)
    - This is a daily heatmap of all your DAW activity since you've had
      a Signalbash account.
- Streaks (Current & All Time)
    - Streaks show how many days in a row you've actively been working in 
      your DAW with the Signalbash plugin.
      - The *Current* Streak is the length in days of your most recent streak
      - The *All-Time* Stream is the length in days of your longest streak
        since you've been using the Signalbash plugin

    - Last 30 Days: How long you've been working in the last 30 days
    - This Year: How long you've spent working since Midnight on January 1st
        of the current year (in your local time)

## How to Create An Account

Signalbash accounts are free to make and do not require an email address.
In fact, Signalbash doesn't ask you for an email address at
any point.

To create an account, visit the [create account](https://signalbash.com/create-account) page on signalbash.com.

You will have to create a user name and enter a password.

## Verifying Your Account

In order to verify your account to start tracking activity, you must
first verify the session key assigned to you after you create your account.

To do this:

- Download & Install the Signalbash Plugin
- Open the Plugin in your DAW
- Copy the Session Key from your Signalbash Account
- Paste the Session Key into the plugin and hit submit.

Once you do this, the Plugin will verify the key, and you'll be able to
start tracking your activity.

### Signalbash User Names

Signalbash user names must be unique. The account creation page will inform
you if the name you want to use is already taken.

Additionally, there is a limited character set that you can use to create
accounts.

The username is what you use to log in in the future, and will be present
in your Signalbash profile URL. Your Username cannot be changed.

If you want to customize how you appear in your profile and on the leaderboard,
you can edit your display name. You can change this as often as you'd like.

#### TIP
It is highly recommend to use a password manager to save your username & password when creating an account.


## Resetting Your Password

You can reset your password in two ways.

1. While logged in:
    - Click Your Profile Icon in the top right corner of the website
    - Click "Manage Account"
    - Navigate to "Reset Password" and fill in the form

2. While logged out:

    If you can't remember your password, you can use your session key to
    log you back in.

    - Go to the login page on signalbash.com
    - Click Forgot Password
    - Enter Your Session Key & The New Password
    - After you click submit, log back into your account with the new password.

    It's very important you keep your session key safe & private because it can
    be used to login.


## Customizing Your Profile

You can customize your profile on Signalbash like any other website. Editing
several of your profile attributes require that you have verified your session
key, so be sure to do that before proceeding.

### Set Profile Image

To set your profile image:
- Go to your Profile Page
- Under the circular image, click "Edit Profile Image"
- On the next page, drag or select an image, and click "use selected image"

For best results, use a high quality square image. Images that aren't
square will be cropped to square from the center.

Transparency/alpha channels are supported.

### Update Profile Attributes

Your Profile Attributes include:

- Your Display Name
- Currently Working On
- Your Country
- Bio

These are all optional fields, which can be used to populate more information
about you. Several have character limits which appear in the input text boxes.

Currently, only the Display Name & Country fields will display on the
signalbash leaderboard.

### Add Your Links

You can add links which will appear on your profile. To do so, click
"Add Link". Add the URL, and the optional "link title" field.



## Deleting Your Signalbash Account

You can easily delete your account at any time. When deleting your account,
all your activity will be permanently deleted. 

To delete your account:
- Click Your Profile Icon in the top right corner of the website
- Click "Manage Account"
- Scroll to "Delete Account"
- Follow the instructions to confirm

Once deleted, your account can't be recovered.
